										<div class="post_text_rule"></div>
										People needing to speak to someone "in charge" (general inquiries, donation offers, media requests, outside event proposals, business collaborations, etc.) should email Hacksburg's Board of Directors at <a href="mailto:board@hacksburg.org">board@hacksburg.org</a>. Messages are checked often, and a Board member will get back to you as soon as they can.

										We have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/405322866198425/?mibextid=6NoCDW">a very active Facebook group</a> where a lot of our community hangs out and discusses various topics related to making things. If you have a question for our community, posting it here is a great way to get a response. Membership in the Hacksburg Facebook group is open to anyone, though you must be approved by a group administrator first (to cut down on spam).<br><br>
We also have <a href="">a separate Facebook page for Hacksburg</a> where we post announcements. We do receive messages from here, but response time is slower than email. If your need is urgent, email is your better bet.

<!--									<div class="post_section">
										<span class="post_section_header">Twitter</span>
										<div class="rule post_text_rule_mini"></div>
										We have a <a href="https://twitter.com/hacksburg">Twitter feed</a> where we post announcements and converse with other tweeters.

									<div class="post_section">
										<span class="post_section_header">Mailing Lists</span>
										<div class="post_text_rule"></div>
										Hacksburg maintains two public mailing lists:<br>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Our <a href="">Announcements List</a>, where we share blog posts and announcements.
											</li>
											<li>
												Our <a href="">Public Discussion List</a>, where our community comes to discuss things related to Hacksburg, the Maker movement, and so on. Membership is open to anyone, but spam is highly discouraged.
											</li>
										</ul>

									<div class="post_section">
										<span class="post_section_header">Dead Tree Mail</span>
										<div class="post_text_rule"></div>
										To send us letters or packages, please use the following address:<br><br>
										Hacksburg<br>
										1872 Kraft Drive<br>
										Suite 1620<br>

									<div class="post_section">
										<span class="post_section_header">In Person</span>
										<div class="post_text_rule"></div>
											If you'd like to talk to someone in person (or just take a tour of the space), we hold open-to-the-public meetings and work sessions at Hacksburg every Tuesday from 7:30 PM to whenever the last member leaves. You'll usually find at least one Board member at these meetings, along with several regulars. Not everyone attends every meeting, so if you want to speak with someone in particular, you should contact them ahead of time to see if they'll be there.
